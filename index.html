    <em>Configuration as Code for Microservice Applications</em>

    <p>
        Konfigraf is a Git-based configuration service that provides management for
        application configuration/settings. Konfigraf is a stateless service which
        provides a simple HTTP API for reading and writing arbitrary files to Git
        repositories which are backed by a Postgres database rather than a file store.
    </p>
    <p>
        When updates are made, Konfigraf can push changes to additional remote Git
        repositories, which allows the configuration and configuration history to be
        accessed in a source code management application such as GitHub, BitBucket,
        or GitLab.
    </p>
    <h3>Why Should You Use Konfigraf?</h3>
    <p>
        &quot;Configuration&quot; is a broad term, in the context of software applications
        it can have several meanings:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Static settings</b> stored in application source code which are intended
            to give developers a central place to manage constants that are used in code.
            These are usually present in the form of a yaml, json, or xml file located at
            the root of a project's source code. Konfigraf is not intended for management
            of static configuration.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Environment variables</b> usually provided as environment variables or as
            files in volumes mounted to a container to provide the application necessary
            information about the context in which it running. Konfigraf is not indended
            for environment information. Though it could be used in such a context, since
            these settings are nearly always applied during the initial provisioning phase
            of an application's lifecycle a simplier solution is likely a better fit. The
            term <em>configuration as code</em> is used to describe a strategy of environment
            configuration management in which this configuration is stored under a source
            control repository like Git.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Application configuration</b> is data usually created by the application at
            runtime, usually by users of an application via an interactive user interface.
            This data is generally stored in a database designed by the developer then 
            subsequently loaded when performing operations to alter the application's runtime
            behavior. This is the use case that Konfigraf was designed to support.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Storing application configuration in a simple CRUD accessed database has a number of
        drawbacks. If this configuration is used as an input to control flow or branch logic,
        and particularly as complexity increases and for systems for which distinct
        &quot;administration&quot; and &quot;user&quot; functions play a significant role,
        this can easily become a sort of application code which is present only in production
        and has no source control applied.
    </p>
    <p>
        Ideally in these cases we'd like to have something like Git to keep a log of changes,
        perform change diff reports, and perhaps even move changes into other environments for
        testing. Unfortunately fulling implementing such a system for an application's runtime
        configuration is a substatial project in and of itself.
    </p>
    <h3>Runtime Application Configuration</h3>
    <p>
        Konfigraf provides HTTP access to Git while still using a SQL database as the
        backing store. This allows similar management and backup of service configuration
        as conventional configuration stored in tables. This configuration can be automatically
        pushed to remote repositories for operational visibility or testing in preview
        environments.

    <p>
        Konfigraf requires Postgres for storage. Optionally, Vault is used to store
        credentials for any remote replicated repositories.
