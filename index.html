    <em>Configuration as Code for Microservice Applications</em>

    <p>
        Konfigraf is a git-based configuration service that provides management for
        application configuration/settings. Konfigraf is a stateless service which
        provides a simple HTTP API for reading and writing arbitrary files to git
        repositories which are backed by a Postgres database rather than a file store.
    </p>
    <p>
        When updates are made, Konfigraf can push changes to additional remote git
        repositories, which allows the configuration and configuration history to be
        accessed in a source code management application such as GitHub, BitBucket,
        or GitLab.
    </p>
    <p>
        Konfigraf is especially useful for applications which allow a lot of runtime
        behavior to be driven by configuration. In such applications, the configuration
        is a sort of de facto source code. Just to be clear, in this context when we talk
        about configuration we mean state that is modified at runtime by an application
        by users of the application, not static configuration stored in source code or an
        environment. The common approach of simply storing service application configuration
        in a SQL database has a number of drawbacks. Fully implementing auditing, change
        diff reports, and other features that are used for source code control is time
        consuming and imposes significant friction on future modifications. By using Git,
        the application gets access to the same tools used to manage code.
    </p>
    <p>
        Konfigraf provides HTTP access to Git while still using a SQL database as the
        backing store. This allows similar management and backup of service configuration
        as conventional configuration stored in tables.

        Konfigraf requires Postgres for storage. Optionally, Vault is used to store
        credentials for any remote replicated repositories.
